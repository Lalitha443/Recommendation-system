# Anime Recommendation System

## Project Description

This project focuses on creating a recommendation system for anime using a dataset of anime ratings. The goal is to provide personalized anime suggestions to users based on their viewing and rating history, helping them discover new series they might enjoy.

## Features

  - **Data Loading and Exploration**: The project starts by loading an `anime.csv` dataset and performing initial data exploration to understand its structure, including the number of rows and columns, and a preview of the data. The dataset includes features such as `anime_id`, `name`, `genre`, `type`, `episodes`, `rating`, and `members`.
  - **Recommendation Logic**: The core of the project is the implementation of a recommendation algorithm that leverages user data to suggest new anime.

## Installation and Setup

1.  Ensure you have Python installed.
2.  Install the required library: `pandas`.
    ```bash
    pip install pandas
    ```
3.  Place the `anime.csv` dataset in the same directory as the Jupyter Notebook.

## Usage

Open the `Recommendation_system.ipynb` file in a Jupyter environment (e.g., Jupyter Notebook, JupyterLab, or Google Colab) and run the cells sequentially to execute the code and generate recommendations.

## Technologies Used

  - Python
  - Pandas for data manipulation and analysis
  - Jupyter Notebook for interactive development and data visualization
